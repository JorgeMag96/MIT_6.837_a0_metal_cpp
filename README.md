Link to the course's curriculum [MIT 6.837 Computer Graphics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-837-computer-graphics-fall-2012/pages/assignments/)

Video lectures by Justin Solomon: [6.837: Introduction to Computer Graphics (fall 2021)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ3UicqQtfNtqt2yL3KgKV-yn0NEPbRVi) 

The difference from the course original instructions is that here we use [CMake](https://cmake.org/), [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/), and [Metal-cpp](https://developer.apple.com/metal/cpp/) to solve the assignment.

Here's a good starting point to learn Metal-cpp with CMake: [LeeTeng2001/metal-cpp-cmake](https://github.com/LeeTeng2001/metal-cpp-cmake)
